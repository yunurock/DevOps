# Docker File 
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions to build a Docker image automatically.

## Why use a Dockerfile?
Instead of manually installing software every time you create a container, you write the steps once in a Dockerfile, and Docker builds the image for you.

Set of DockerFile Instructions:
===============================
- FROM: where to download the base image.
- MAINTAINER: Non executable instruction used to indicate the author of DockerFile.
- COPY: Copy file from docker host to image.
- ADD: It copy the file from source to destination and also extracts the file.
- CMD: It specifies the intended command for the image.
- ENTRYPOINT: when the container is up,entry point is the starting of execution.
- ENV: This instruction can be used to set the env variables in the container.
- EXPOSE: expose a specified port.
- RUN: This instruction is used to execute a command on top of an existing layer.
- USER: This is used to set the username.
- VOLUME: Volume instruction is used to enable access to a location.
- WORKDIR: To change the directory.
- ONBUILD: It will add a trigger instruction.

## Difference between ADD and COPY?
COPY module is just to copy a file from local to the image.
ADD is also used to copy file from local to image and we can download any file from internet using add, we can extract the compose file using ADD.

## Differnce between RUN and CMD?
RUN let's you execute commands inside docker image.These commands get executed once at build time and
get written into your docker image as a new layer.
EX:- RUN mkdir -p /path-to-folder
CMD is  a docker run time operation.Meaning its not something that gets executed at build time.
It happens when you run an image.A running image is called container.
Only one CMD can be used in a DockerFile,if we use multiple then only last CMD will be used.

## Difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?
Both are similar but not same and act as executable commands when running the container.
CMD can be override,if we pass other argument.
ENTRYPOINT cannot be overriden.
we cna use multiple CMD but only last one will be considered at runtime.

EX:_
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
ENTRYPOINT ["echo","hello"]
CMD ["WORLD"]
